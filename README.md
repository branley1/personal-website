# Personal Website
This is my personal website project. I created this website to showcase my skills, experience, and projects to potential employers and clients.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

## Features
Responsive design: The website is optimized to look good on all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
Navigation bar: The navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to easily navigate to different sections of the website.
Projects and certifications: The "Projects & Certifications" section showcases some of my notable projects and certifications.
Contact information: The "Contact" section provides users with various ways to contact me, including email and social media.

## How to Use
To view the website, simply open the second-website.html file in a web browser. The website should be fully functional and responsive.

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to add more projects and certifications to the website, as well as improve the overall design and user experience.

## Credits
The website was mainly designed by me, and I tried to apply every bit of personalization to make the project unique and stand out.
The navigation bar was inspired by the navigation bar on Swarthmore College's website.

## Licences
At the moment licensing is done through me, and if anyone needs any piece of the code please do not hesistate to reach out to me via email: mmasi.branley@gmail.com
